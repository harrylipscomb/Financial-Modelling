# Financial-Modelling

Developed a three statement model of Alphabet's operations to determine enterprise and equity value using both FCFF and FCFE. Explored sensitivity tables, WACC determination, amortization/revolvers, scenario simulations and built a model which determined metrics based on either broker or independently determined forecasts for financial lines of cash flow, the balance sheet and income statement.
